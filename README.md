# Drone_project

The simulator is a drone environment simulation where there are enemies represented as green circles
and drones represented as red circles. It aims to create an interactive environment where drones and
enemies can navigate, interact, and potentially engage in strategic behaviors.
The drones and enemies can move in various directions within the environment, allowing for dynamic
movement patterns and interactions.
The drones have additional capabilities, such as the ability to change colors and reach higher ground,
providing them with increased versatility and strategic options.
In addition to the drones and enemies, the environment features shadow zones, which are areas where both
drones and enemies can enter. These shadow zones introduce an additional element to the simulation and
can potentially affect the behavior and interactions of the entities within them.
Overall, the simulator aims to provide a realistic and immersive simulation of a drone-based scenario,
allowing for the exploration and analysis of various drone and enemy interactions within the simulated
environment.
